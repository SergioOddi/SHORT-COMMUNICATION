## VERSIONE 1 - FOCUS SU MECCANISMO (247 parole)

**Background:** Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), an endogenous lipid mediator, exerts robust neuroprotective effects in male Tg2576 mice, improving cognitive performance, synaptic integrity, and reducing neuroinflammation. However, given the well-documented sexual dimorphism in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis and the higher prevalence in women (~2/3 of patients), it remains unknown whether PEA retains its therapeutic efficacy in females.

**Methods:** We administered PEA (30 mg/kg/day via slow-release subcutaneous pellets) to female Tg2576 mice for 6 months (age 6-12 months) and evaluated cognitive function (Novel Object Recognition Test), hippocampal dendritic spine density, and nitrosative stress. We measured FAAH and NAAA expression and activity in female versus male Tg2576 mice to investigate potential sex-specific differences in PEA metabolism.

**Results:** Unlike males, PEA treatment completely failed to ameliorate cognitive deficits, restore dendritic spine density, or reduce 3-nitrotyrosine levels in female Tg2576 mice. Mechanistically, female Tg2576 mice exhibited massive upregulation of the PEA-degrading enzymes FAAH (fatty acid amide hydrolase) and NAAA (N-acylethanolamine acid amidase) at the mRNA, protein, and enzymatic activity levels, with ~4-fold higher activity compared to males. This hyperactive catabolic machinery likely prevents PEA from reaching therapeutically effective brain concentrations.

**Conclusion:** We identify a sex-dependent mechanism of pharmacological resistance to PEA mediated by FAAH/NAAA hyperactivity, potentially regulated by estrogen-responsive elements in gene promoters. Our findings have immediate implications for precision medicine in AD, suggesting that female patients may require combination therapies with FAAH/NAAA inhibitors to achieve neuroprotection.

## VERSIONE 2 - FOCUS SU IMPATTO CLINICO (243 parole)

**Background:** Women represent approximately two-thirds of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and exhibit more rapid disease progression than men. We recently demonstrated that chronic palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) treatment rescues cognitive deficits and synaptic loss in male Tg2576 mice. However, the efficacy of PEA in females—the predominant patient population—remained unexplored.

**Methods:** Female Tg2576 mice received PEA (30 mg/kg/day) via subcutaneous slow-release pellets for 6 months (age 6-12 months). We assessed cognitive performance, hippocampal dendritic spine density, and nitrosative stress markers. To investigate mechanisms of potential sex-specific responses, we quantified FAAH and NAAA expression and enzymatic activity in male versus female Tg2576 hippocampus.

**Results:** PEA treatment was completely ineffective in female Tg2576 mice, failing to improve cognitive performance (Novel Object Recognition Test), restore dendritic spine density in CA1 hippocampus, or reduce 3-nitrotyrosine accumulation. This striking sex-specific therapeutic failure was associated with massive upregulation of PEA-degrading enzymes in females: FAAH and NAAA exhibited ~4-fold higher enzymatic activity in female versus male Tg2576 mice, accompanied by increased mRNA and protein expression. This hyperactive catabolic state likely results in accelerated PEA clearance, preventing accumulation of therapeutically relevant brain concentrations.

**Conclusion:** We demonstrate that sex-specific differences in endocannabinoid metabolism determine therapeutic responses to PEA in AD models. These findings mandate sex-stratified approaches in preclinical cannabinoid research and suggest that female AD patients may require combination therapies with enzyme inhibitors to overcome metabolic resistance.

## VERSIONE 3 - BILANCIATA (248 parole) ⭐ RACCOMANDATA

**Background:** Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) ameliorates cognitive dysfunction and neuroinflammation in male Tg2576 mice, a model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, sexual dimorphism is well-documented in AD, with women comprising ~2/3 of patients and exhibiting more aggressive disease progression. Whether PEA retains neuroprotective efficacy in females remains unknown, yet is critical given potential sex differences in endocannabinoid metabolism.

**Methods:** We treated female Tg2576 mice with PEA (30 mg/kg/day, 6 months) using the identical protocol previously validated in males. We evaluated cognitive performance (Novel Object Recognition Test), hippocampal dendritic spine density, and nitrosative stress (3-nitrotyrosine). To elucidate mechanisms of sex-specific responses, we quantified FAAH and NAAA—the principal PEA-degrading enzymes—at mRNA, protein, and enzymatic activity levels in male versus female Tg2576 hippocampus.

**Results:** PEA treatment was completely ineffective in female Tg2576 mice across all therapeutic endpoints: cognitive deficits, synaptic loss, and nitrosative stress remained unchanged. This striking therapeutic failure was mechanistically linked to massive upregulation of PEA catabolism: female Tg2576 mice exhibited ~4-fold higher FAAH and NAAA enzymatic activity compared to males, accompanied by increased mRNA and protein expression. This hyperactive catabolic state likely prevents PEA from reaching therapeutically effective concentrations.

**Conclusion:** We identify sex-dependent FAAH/NAAA hyperactivity as a mechanism of pharmacological resistance to PEA, potentially mediated by estrogen-responsive elements in gene promoters. Our findings mandate sex-stratified preclinical studies and suggest that female AD patients may benefit from combination therapies with enzyme inhibitors to achieve neuroprotection comparable to males.

## VERSIONE 4 - ULTRA-CONCISA (199 parole)

**Background:** Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) exerts neuroprotective effects in male Tg2576 mice. We investigated whether this efficacy extends to females, given sexual dimorphism in Alzheimer's disease and endocannabinoid metabolism.

**Methods:** Female Tg2576 mice received PEA (30 mg/kg/day, 6 months). We assessed cognitive function, synaptic integrity, and nitrosative stress. We measured FAAH and NAAA enzymatic activity in males versus females to investigate sex-specific PEA metabolism.

**Results:** Unlike males, PEA failed to improve cognition, restore dendritic spine density, or reduce nitrosative stress in female Tg2576 mice. Female mice exhibited ~4-fold higher FAAH and NAAA enzymatic activity compared to males, with corresponding increases in mRNA and protein expression. This hyperactive PEA catabolism likely prevents accumulation of therapeutic brain concentrations.

**Conclusion:** Sex-dependent FAAH/NAAA hyperactivity, potentially regulated by estrogen-responsive elements, mediates pharmacological resistance to PEA in female Tg2576 mice. Our findings have immediate implications for AD therapeutics: (1) sex-stratification is essential in preclinical cannabinoid studies; (2) female patients may require combination therapies with enzyme inhibitors. This study identifies a critical mechanism underlying sex differences in therapeutic responses and provides a rationale for personalized, sex-specific AD treatments.

## VERSIONE 5 - STILE "NATURE-LIKE" (235 parole)

Sexual dimorphism profoundly influences Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, yet most preclinical therapeutic studies employ only male subjects. Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), an endogenous lipid mediator with PPAR-α agonist properties, ameliorates cognitive deficits and synaptic loss in male Tg2576 mice. Here, we demonstrate complete therapeutic failure of PEA in female Tg2576 mice and identify the underlying molecular mechanism.

Female Tg2576 mice treated with PEA (30 mg/kg/day, 6 months) showed no improvement in cognitive performance, dendritic spine density, or nitrosative stress—endpoints robustly rescued in males. Mechanistic investigation revealed massive upregulation of PEA-degrading enzymes in females: FAAH (fatty acid amide hydrolase) and NAAA (N-acylethanolamine acid amidase) exhibited ~4-fold higher enzymatic activity in female versus male Tg2576 hippocampus, with corresponding increases in mRNA and protein expression. This hyperactive catabolic machinery creates a "metabolic sink" that degrades exogenous PEA before it reaches therapeutically effective concentrations.

Given that FAAH and NAAA promoters contain estrogen-responsive elements, our findings suggest hormonal regulation of endocannabinoid metabolism as a determinant of therapeutic responses. These results mandate sex-stratified approaches in preclinical cannabinoid research and have immediate translational implications: female AD patients may require combination therapies with FAAH/NAAA inhibitors to overcome metabolic resistance. Our study provides a molecular framework for understanding sex differences in AD therapeutics and advancing precision medicine approaches.
