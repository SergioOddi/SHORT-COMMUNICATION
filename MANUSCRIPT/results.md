## 3.1 PEA restores recognition memory in male but not female Tg2576 mice

To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of chronic PEA administration on cognitive function, we assessed recognition memory using the Novel Object Recognition Test (NORT) in Tg2576 mice of both sexes. Based on the neuroprotective effects previously reported in males (Tortolani et al., 2025), we hypothesized that PEA would similarly improve cognitive performance in females.

Importantly, vehicle-treated female Tg2576 mice displayed a significant cognitive deficit compared to wild-type littermates (discrimination index: 53.8 ± 6.7% vs. 66.1 ± 11.5%), confirming that amyloid pathology impairs recognition memory in females as well as in males at this age.

A two-way ANOVA (Sex × Treatment) on Tg2576 mice revealed a significant main effect of Treatment (F(1,38) = 8.69, p = 0.005, η² = 0.170), indicating that PEA influenced recognition memory across both sexes. The main effect of Sex was not significant (F(1,38) = 2.67, p = 0.111, η² = 0.052), nor was the Sex × Treatment interaction (F(1,38) = 1.71, p = 0.199, η² = 0.033).

Planned contrasts, corrected for two comparisons (Bonferroni-adjusted α = 0.025), revealed a clear dissociation between sexes. In males, PEA-treated mice showed significantly higher discrimination indices compared to vehicle-treated controls (57.5 ± 13.0% vs. 44.5 ± 5.2%; t(12.3) = 2.90, p = 0.013; Cohen's d = 1.26, 95% CI [0.16, 2.36]), confirming the robust cognitive benefit previously reported and corresponding to a large effect size. In females, however, the difference between PEA and vehicle groups did not reach statistical significance (59.1 ± 10.3% vs. 53.8 ± 6.7%; t(18.9) = 1.49, p = 0.152; Cohen's d = 0.61, 95% CI [−0.26, 1.48]).

Notably, the effect size in females (d = 0.61) was approximately half of that observed in males (d = 1.26), suggesting a markedly attenuated rather than entirely absent response to PEA. The 95% confidence interval for the mean difference in females [−2.1, 12.7] included zero, precluding definitive conclusions about treatment efficacy. Taken together, these data indicate that despite comparable cognitive impairment at baseline, PEA produces a robust and replicable cognitive benefit in male Tg2576 mice while its effect is substantially diminished in females.

## 3.2 PEA increases basal but not apical dendritic spine density selectively in male Tg2576 mice

To determine whether PEA-mediated synaptic protection extends to both sexes, we quantified dendritic spine density in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons (Golgi staining) across apical and basal dendritic compartments. Since several groups deviated from normality (Shapiro-Wilk, p < 0.05), non-parametric analyses were employed throughout.

**Apical dendrites.** An omnibus Kruskal-Wallis test across the four Tg2576 groups was highly significant (χ²(3) = 30.26, p < 0.001), reflecting substantial between-group variability. However, planned contrasts (Bonferroni-adjusted α = 0.025) indicated that PEA did not significantly increase apical spine density in either sex. In males, median density was 1.49 spines/μm in the PEA group versus 1.30 in vehicle controls (W = 259, p = 0.113; Cliff's δ = 0.295, 95% CI [−0.075, 0.593]; small effect). In females, median density was 2.64 versus 2.27 (W = 232, p = 0.243; Cliff's δ = 0.221, 95% CI [−0.172, 0.553]; small effect). In both cases, the confidence intervals for the Hodges-Lehmann estimate included zero.

**Basal dendrites.** The Kruskal-Wallis test was again highly significant (χ²(3) = 36.00, p < 0.001). Planned contrasts revealed a clear sex-dependent pattern. In males, PEA significantly increased basal spine density (median 1.50 vs. 1.22 spines/μm; W = 298, p = 0.008; Cliff's δ = 0.490, 95% CI [0.135, 0.734]; large effect), with the Hodges-Lehmann estimate of 0.32 spines/μm (95% CI [0.09, 0.77]) excluding zero. In females, no significant effect was observed (median 2.64 vs. 2.11; W = 234.5, p = 0.216; Cliff's δ = 0.234, 95% CI [−0.167, 0.569]; small effect).

Thus, the synaptic benefit of PEA in Tg2576 mice is compartment-specific and sex-dependent: a robust effect on basal spine density in males, with no significant effect in either compartment in females. Of note, female Tg2576 mice exhibited substantially higher baseline spine densities than males in both compartments (apical: 2.21 vs. 1.42; basal: 2.11 vs. 1.21), a pattern also observed in wild-type littermates and likely reflecting an intrinsic sexual dimorphism in dendritic morphology (see Discussion).

## 3.3 PEA reduces hippocampal nitrosative stress in male but not female Tg2576 mice

To assess whether PEA counteracts nitrosative damage in a sex-dependent manner, we measured hippocampal 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) levels by immunohistochemistry.

Vehicle-treated female Tg2576 mice exhibited elevated 3-NT levels compared to those previously reported in wild-type controls, indicating that amyloid-driven nitrosative stress is present in females, albeit at lower absolute levels than in males (female veh: 9.73 ± 3.49; male veh: 19.06 ± 2.12).

A two-way ANOVA (Sex × Treatment) revealed that Sex was the dominant source of variance (F(1,24) = 60.45, p < 0.001, η² = 0.576), with males showing approximately twice the 3-NT levels of females regardless of treatment. Treatment also had a significant main effect (F(1,24) = 16.65, p < 0.001, η² = 0.159). The Sex × Treatment interaction approached but did not reach significance (F(1,24) = 3.92, p = 0.059, η² = 0.037), suggesting a trend toward differential PEA efficacy between sexes.

Planned contrasts (Bonferroni-adjusted α = 0.025) confirmed a striking sex-dependent response. In males, PEA produced a marked reduction in 3-NT levels (19.06 ± 2.12 vs. 13.26 ± 2.10; t(12.0) = 5.14, p = 0.0002; Cohen's d = 2.75, 95% CI [1.12, 4.37]), representing a 30% decrease and the largest effect size observed across all endpoints. In females, 3-NT levels were numerically lower in the PEA group but the difference was not significant (9.73 ± 3.49 vs. 7.72 ± 2.12; t(9.9) = 1.30, p = 0.223; Cohen's d = 0.70, 95% CI [−0.50, 1.90]). The 95% confidence interval for the mean difference in females [−1.44, 5.46] included zero.

The pattern across the three neuroprotective endpoints is consistent: PEA exerts robust therapeutic effects in male Tg2576 mice (NOR: d = 1.26; basal spines: Cliff's δ = 0.49; 3-NT: d = 2.75) while its efficacy is systematically attenuated in females (NOR: d = 0.61; basal spines: Cliff's δ = 0.23; 3-NT: d = 0.70), despite the presence of amyloid-related pathology in both sexes. This consistent dissociation points to a sex-specific factor that limits PEA bioavailability or signaling in females.

## 3.4 Female Tg2576 mice overexpress the PEA-degrading enzymes FAAH and NAAA

The systematic attenuation of PEA efficacy across all endpoints in females prompted us to investigate a potential pharmacokinetic explanation. PEA is an endogenous lipid mediator whose brain levels are tightly regulated by the balance between biosynthesis and enzymatic degradation. Two hydrolases are primarily responsible for PEA catabolism: fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and N-acylethanolamine acid amidase (NAAA). Critically, the promoter regions of both genes contain estrogen-responsive elements (ERE), raising the possibility that their expression may be upregulated in a sex-dependent manner. We therefore measured FAAH and NAAA expression in the hippocampus of vehicle-treated male and female Tg2576 mice to test whether sex differences in catabolic enzyme levels could account for the attenuated therapeutic response observed in females.
