The sex-dependent difference in treatment response extended beyond cognitive performance to the structural integrity of hippocampal circuitry. Golgi analysis of CA1 pyramidal neurons revealed that PEA selectively restored basal dendritic spine density in male Tg2576 mice (Cliff's δ = 0.49, p = 0.008), while females remained unresponsive to treatment (δ = 0.23, p = 0.216). No significant effect was detected on apical dendrites in either sex, suggesting that PEA-mediated synaptic protection, when present, is preferentially expressed in the basal compartment at this disease stage.

A notable feature of the data was the markedly higher baseline spine density in females relative to males, observed in both the apical (2.21 vs. 1.42 spines/μm) and basal (2.11 vs. 1.21 spines/μm) compartments. This dimorphism was not disease-related, as it was equally apparent in wild-type littermates, and most likely reflects well-established estrogen-dependent regulation of dendritic spine dynamics. While this structural advantage could in principle reduce the apparent magnitude of PEA-mediated rescue in females — leaving less synaptic loss to restore — it cannot account for the parallel absence of PEA efficacy on cognitive performance, where both sexes exhibited comparable deficits relative to wild-type controls.
